// Package manage_table documentation
// Contains all the functions, interfaces, structs, etc. needed to
// create, manage and remove/delete a card table(s), with all the
// physical items required to paly a game of cards, so
// chips, cards, seats/chairs, card shuffler?...
// We expect to be used by a dealer and room manager.
// - create a struct representing a table
// - all methods/functions needed to manipulate all physical
// items on the table
// - allow for multiple tables to exist at the same time, so
// have "table instances"
// - each table instance is going to be the structure where the state of the game is
// reflected.
